# Introduction & Explanation

BetArbit is a simple cli-based arbitrage bet detection and return calculation algorithm. The algorithm uses free data from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) to determine if there exists opportunities to place bets that have guaranteed return.

I do not warrant that this works as it is based purely on [theory](http://www.aussportsbetting.com/guide/sports-betting-arbitrage/) and I have not used it in practice, nor do I recommend you do either. This is simply a code-based demonstration of methods to potentially beat market-makers.
